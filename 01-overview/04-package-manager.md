# Package Managers in Linux

## 📌 What is a Package Manager?
A **package manager** is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software in a Linux system. It ensures that software and its dependencies are managed efficiently.

## 🔍 How Does a Package Manager Work?
1. **Repositories (Repos):**
   - A package manager fetches software from **official repositories (online storage of packages).**
   - Example: Ubuntu gets packages from `archive.ubuntu.com`.

2. **Installing Software:**
   - When you install software, the package manager:
     ✅ Downloads the package from the repository.
     ✅ Resolves dependencies (installs additional required software).
     ✅ Installs and configures the software automatically.
